# Figures
In this repo, there are some figures made by myself. If you use it, please refer to me.

## Software_Map.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the percentage of published EM density maps by each EM image data
processing software.

## Software_Resolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the highest resolution and the average resolution of EM density
map by each EM image data processing software.

## Year_Map_Resolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the number of EM density maps published in each year.

## Normalized_Sinc.png
It demonstrates a normalized sinc function. x ranges from -8 to 8.

## Software_Map_HighResolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 18, 2015.
It demonstrates the percentage of published EM density maps at the resolution
above 4 angstrom by each EM image data processing software.

## Rotation_Average_CTF_Astigmatism.png
It demonstrates the rotation average result of ideal CTF with astigmatism.
* Size: 512 x 512
* lambda: 0.01A
* DF1: 1e4
* DF2: 2e4
* ANG: PI / 2
* Cs: 0

## Motion_Correction_Quality.png
A method developed by me to quantitive measure the quality of motion-correction.
* Size: 3838 x 3710
* lambda: 0.0196A
* DF1: 17963
* DF2: 18713
* ANG: 45

## Irradiation_Injury_FRC.png
The Influence of irradiation injury on FRC of a cryo-EM stack. 
The stack is a 32-frame movie. Using frames 3-14 as reference, the curve fitting
is performed on FRC calculated between the reference and each 3-frame summation,
shown in this figure.
