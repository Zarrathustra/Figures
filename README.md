# Figures
In this repo, there are some figures made by myself. If you use it, please refer to me.

## Software_Map.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the percentage of published EM density maps by each EM image data
processing software.

## Software_Resolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the highest resolution and the average resolution of EM density
map by each EM image data processing software.

## Year_Map_Resolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 14, 2015.
It demonstrates the number of EM density maps published in each year.

## Normalized_Sinc.png
It demonstrates a normalized sinc function. x ranges from -8 to 8.

## Software_Map_HighResolution.png
Data is collected from EMDB on May 18, 2015.
It demonstrates the percentage of published EM density maps at the resolution
above 4 angstrom by each EM image data processing software.

## RotationAverageCTFAstigmatism.png
It demonstrates the rotation average result of ideal CTF with astigmatism.
